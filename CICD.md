Subject: Request to Implement CI/CD Using Jenkins and Tomcat 9

Dear DevOps Team,

I am writing to request your support in setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) using Jenkins and Tomcat 9 for our project.

**Project Overview:**
We aim to streamline our software deployment process by implementing a CI/CD. Our goal is to automate the build and deployment of our web application hosted on Tomcat 9. 
The workflow involves separate servers for Jenkins and Tomcat:

- Jenkins Server: Ubuntu Server/AWS Linux Machine
- Tomcat Server: Separate machine hosting Tomcat 9

**Requirements:**
1. Configure Jenkins on the Ubuntu Server/AWS Linux Machine.
2. Set up the Jenkins CI/CD to:
   - Fetch the source code from our version control system.
   - Build the code using Maven.
   - Generate a deployable WAR file.
   - Deploy the WAR file to the Tomcat 9 server.
3. **Use the below code to build**
   - https://github.com/arvnddevops/webapp1.git 

**Process Overview:**
We anticipate the CI/CD process to involve the following steps:
- Jenkins fetches the code from our repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Jenkins runs build processes using Maven.
- Upon successful build, Jenkins generates a WAR file.
- Jenkins deploys this WAR file to the Tomcat 9 server for production/staging.

**Project Timelines:**
We aim to implement this CI/CD at the earliest feasible timeline. However, we understand the complexity and coordination required for such setups.
Please provide an estimated timeline for the setup and any additional information or requirements from our end to facilitate this process.

**Collaboration and Communication:**
We are committed to collaborating and providing any necessary support to ensure the successful implementation of this CI/CD  . 
Kindly let us know how we can assist in the process and if there are any specific details or configurations required from our side.

Your expertise in setting up this CI/CD will significantly benefit our project by enhancing our deployment processes. We greatly appreciate your efforts in this initiative.
